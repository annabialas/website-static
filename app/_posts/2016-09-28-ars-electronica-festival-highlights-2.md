I'm sharing more highlights from this year's [Ars Electronica Festival](http://www.aec.at/festival/en/). See [part one](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/2016/09/12/ars-electronica-festival-highlights/) for more highlights.





**Animated restroom sign** - The men's bathroom had the best sign ever! I've never been so delighted by a bathroom sign. Playful and fun use of a projector and an animation.





**[Interface I](http://www.rlfbckr.org/work/interface-i) by Ralf Baecker** - A red horizontal line is adjusted up and down the vertical axis to make a fluid line graph irl. The horizontal line seems to be controlled by hundreds of little motors moving thin clear cable up and down. Gorgeously lit and placed in a large dark room.





**Single Stroke Structures by Takahiro Hasegawa and Yasuaki Kakehi** - make temporary structures (maybe even phone booths!?!) out of strategically crimped, inflated plastic tubing. How amazing would it be to keep a shed in your backpack?

**[Highlight](http://highlight.digital.udk-berlin.de/) by Jussi Ängeslavä, Michael Burk, Iohanna Nicenboim** - direct light using a lampshade. 3D printing allows for the matching of shade with the room - direct light where you want it.

**[![j](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/j-225x300.jpg)](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/j.jpg)Photosynth printing** - print on plants. Mask the leaf and expose the rest to light that causes alters the photosynth process.
