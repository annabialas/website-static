Hi, this is David Weinberger, and I'm thrilled to be able to post that on Monday I'll be the Lab's new co-director, along with the fabulous Kim Dulin who has over the past year hired an amazing group of people and guided them toward a set of awesome projects. 

I've posted a bit about this new job over at [my personal blog](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2010/08/20/my-new-job/). 

I've been working with the Lab as a consultant for quite a while now, and with Kim and the team, for whom I have the highest regard, so this is not a big change for the Lab. But it is a very happy change for me.
