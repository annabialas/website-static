The [Watertown Free Public Library](http://www.watertownlib.org/) has fully embraced the Awesome Box. They have not one but two Awesome Boxes -- one at the main circulation desk and one at the circulation desk in the children's room.




The Awesome Box in the children's room has a button that when pressed says "Awesome."

In addition to the boxes, they've installed a display that oozes awesome. With the display, the boxes, and the button, it's a full awesome experience.



Pop by the [WFPL](http://www.watertownlib.org/location-hours/directions) in person and checkout the [things they've Awesomed on the Web](http://watertown.awesomebox.io/).
