we hosted a bunch of amazing visitors earlier this week (knight prototype workshop!) and we wereÂ fortunate enough to gather everyone for dinner. after drinks were served, i used my phone's camera and swooped into each booth aka pocket of people.

swooping into these pockets of people is surprisingly meaningful and rich -- i very much get a distinct sense for the vibe/mood/energy at each table. this swoop in and pan pattern is deep.

what should i do with these clips? feels like there's some coolness here but i can't seem to grab it. ideas?
