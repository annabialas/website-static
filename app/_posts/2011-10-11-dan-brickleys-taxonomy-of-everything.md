We've been working with the brilliant [Dan Brickley](http://danbri.org) all summer (he's very modest, so now I've embarrassed him) trying to figure out how to use all available metadata to slot Web content into library categorization schemes automagically. For example, if we include in our collection -- or, more to the point, if the [DPLA](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/dpla/Main_Page) includes in its collection -- library-worthy material such as [TED talks](http://www.ted.com), is there a way in which we could automatically categorize those talks within the general mix of library items? We'd like to be able to do this at scale, even if roughly.

No one knows linked open data better than Dan (there, I've embarrassed him again!), and he's been experimenting with all sorts of metadata and connections. Today he [posted](http://danbri.org/words/2011/10/11/720) about what he's been up to. It's pretty damn fascinating, and our team has learned a ton working with him on this all summer. We're looking forward to more!
