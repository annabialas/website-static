A [report](http://crc.nottingham.ac.uk/projects/rcs/Chemists&EconomistsViews_on_OA.pdf) on a survey of 350 chemists and 350 economists in  UK universities leads to the following conclusion about open access publishing:



<blockquote>...our work with researchers on the ground indicates to us that whatever the enthusiasm and optimism within the OA community, it has not spilled into academia to a large extent and has had only a small effect on the publishing habits and perceptions of ordinary researchers, whatever their seniority and whether in Chemistry or Economics.</blockquote>



The report finds that faculty members want to publish in high "impact factor" journals unless they have some specific reason why they should go the Open Access route, e.g., they need to get something out quickly. The subscriptions their libraries buy mask from them the extent to which their work becomes inaccessible to those who are not a university.

The report ends with some recommendations for trying to move academics towards OA publishing.
