Science Magazine reports on a study sponsored by the EU that found that 89% of the 50,000 researchers surveyed think open access is good for their field. On the other hand, the reporter, Gretchen Vogel, points out that while 53% said they had published at least one open access article, only 10% of papers are published in open access journals. What's holding them back from doing more open access publishing? About 40% said it was because there wasn't enough funding to cover the publication fees, and 30% said there weren't high-quality open access journals in their field. 

The data and analysis is supposed to become available this week at [The SOAP Project](http://project-soap.eu/). Unfortunately, the [Science Magazine article](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6015/273.1.full.pdf?sid=b6898b0e-de8a-4976-ad49-3f23264e9c3c) covering the report is only available  to members of the AAAS or to those willing to pay $15 for 24 hours of access.
