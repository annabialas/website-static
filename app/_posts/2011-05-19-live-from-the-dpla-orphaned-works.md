Here are two podcasts from the DPLA meeting in Amsterdam this week. Jonathan Rothman of the HathiTrust and Paola Mazzucchi of Arrow talk about their projects for identifying the copyright holders of "orphaned works," i.e., works that are in copyright whose copyright holders are not known and/or findable.





I'll post more interviews tomorrow.
