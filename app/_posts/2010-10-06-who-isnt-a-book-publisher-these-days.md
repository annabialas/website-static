Barnes & Noble has launched [PubIt](http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=pi_reg_home), a service for authors who want to publish directly to readers  -- well, directly through B&N.; Create a B&N; user account and upload some files, and PubIt will convert them to ePub, list your book on its site, collect money from sales, and about 60 days later will send you your money.

Some miscellaneous [points](http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=support#pricing_payment_terms) about PubIt: You can optionally add DRM to your books, but you don't have to. You don't need an ISBN number. You set the list price, but B&N; can set the sale price. You have to charge at least $0.99. You have to guarantee that you won't list it for less elsewhere. 

How much does an author make per copy? B&N; [says](http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=support#pricing_payment_terms): 65% of the list price for books priced at $2.99-$9.99, and 40% for books outside of that range. But a warning: I think I got that right, but B&N; refers to the money paid to "the Publisher," leaving us to figure out whether the publisher is the author or B&N.; It's getting so hard to tell!

(BTW, you can still buy [books](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/My-Hundred-Million-Dollar-Secret/David-Weinberger/e/9781847288004/?itm=1&USRI=my+hundred+million+dollar+secret) published at [LuLu.com](http://www.lulu.com) at B&N.;)
