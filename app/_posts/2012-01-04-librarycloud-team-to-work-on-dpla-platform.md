The Digital Public Library of America today [announced](http://dp.la/2012/01/04/announcing-our-interim-technical-development-team/) that initial (and interim) development work on the DPLA platform will be done by the LibraryCloud team here at the Library Innovation Lab -- Paul Deschner, Matthew Phillips, and David Weinberger -- plus our Berkman friends, Daniel Collis-Puro and Sebastian Diaz. We'll do this as openly as possible, relying upon the community to help at every phase, but this will be our core work during the first phase of the platform's development, leading up to an April 26 DPLA Steering Committee meeting. 

The DPLA platform will enable developers to write applications using the metadata (primarily about content hosted elsewhere) the DPLA will be aggregating.

We're excited. Thrilled, actually.
