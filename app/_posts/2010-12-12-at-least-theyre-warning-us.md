A friend of my son at Brown showed him a note  tucked inside a book on the history of Russian anarchism:
[![Department of Homeland Security warning - an activist hoax](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dhs-unsafe-book-205x300.jpg)](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dhs-unsafe-book.jpg)

It turns out to be a [hoax](http://ultraviolet.in/2009/06/30/the-fear-of-feminism/) played by some activists -- all too believably.
