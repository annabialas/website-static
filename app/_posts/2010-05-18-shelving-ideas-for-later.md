This is a really good talk.  People give these advice talks about creativity/innovation etc. all the time, but this one by Jack Dorsey (twitter inventor) is absolutely worth the time. really got me thinking. He's a real inventor.  His newest idea is pretty awesome as well.

It also reminded me of the[ Library Hose](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/twitter/).  Not because of Twitter (which is the broadcast channel for this), but because it was an idea that we did a while back and kinda shelved.  And now its coming back around into ShelfLife.
