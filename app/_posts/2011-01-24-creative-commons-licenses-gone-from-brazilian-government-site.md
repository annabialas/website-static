According to Marilia Maciel at [InfoJustice](http://infojustice.org/archives/867):



<blockquote>[![](http://infojustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/creative_commons2-300x113.jpg)](http://infojustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/creative_commons2.jpg)The Brazilian Ministry of Culture has removed the logo of the Creative Commons license from its [website](http://www.cultura.gov.br/site/). Since Gilberto Gil was ahead of the Ministry (2003-2008), all the content of the website has been licensed in Creative Commons.

> The removal has been interpreted by the Brazilian civil society as a sign of the Minister Â´s inflexibility. The removal came right after the publicization of an [open letter](http://culturadigital.br/cartaaberta/), asking for the continuation of the policies that were adopted or were under discussion during the government of Lula. Minister Ana de Hollanda has [criticized](../archives/713) the proposal for copyright reform, which would, among of things, introduce important exceptions and limitations in Brazilian law.
