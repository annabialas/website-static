According to [Inside Higher Ed](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/07/28/copyright), the US Copyright Office has approved "“sweeping new exemptions to the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act” that allow the educational use of clips of movies decrypted from locked DVDs. Previously the act of decrypting the DVDs was itself (arguably) a violation of the DMCA.
