Jean-Claude Bradley at [Useful Chemistry](http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/) has [announced](http://usefulchem.blogspot.com/2011/02/alfa-aesar-melting-point-data-now.html) (well, a few weeks ago) that the international chemical company [Alfa Aesar](http://www.alfa.com/) has agreed to open source its melting point data. This is important not just because Alfa Aesar is one of the most important sources of that information. It also provides a model that could work outside of chemistry and science. 



The data will be useful to the [Open Notebook Science solubility project](http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/), and because Alfa has agreed to  Open Data access, it can be useful far beyond that. In return, the Open Notebook folks cleaned up Alfa's data, putting it into a clean database format, providing unique IDs (ChemSpiderIDs), and linking back to the Alfa Aesar catalog page. 



Open Notebook then merged the cleaned-up data set with several others. The result was a set of 13,436 Open Data melting point values.



They then created a [Web tool for exploring the merged dataset](http://lxsrv7.oru.edu/~alang/meltingpoints/). 



Why stop with melting points? Why stop with chemistry? Open data for, say, books could lead readers to libraries, publishers, bookstores, courses, other readers...
