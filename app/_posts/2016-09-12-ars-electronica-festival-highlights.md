I'm so insanely happy to be at the [2016 edition of the Ars Electronica Festival](http://www.aec.at/festival/en/). I've wanted to attend for a long time and this year things came together. The festival is as good as I expected.



The scale is large - seemingly endless talks, workshops, and exhibits spread throughout the city of Linz (Austria). I won't attempt any type of comprehensive overview but will share my personal highlights.

[**Portrait on the fly**](http://www.interface.ufg.ac.at/christa-laurent/WORKS/artworks/PortraitOnTheFly-Interactive/PortraitOnTheFly.html) by Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau is an interactive piece - stand in front of it (a monitor with a camera on top) and you see an outline of yourself. You quickly realize the outline is made of buzzing flies. The monitor/camera is surrounded by fantastic printed portraits generated by the installation.

**Body Pressure** (this is a placeholder name until I track down the correct name) - lay down on a large deflated bag and feel it lift you toward another inflating bag. The two inflated forms come together gently squeezing you between. This piece is beautiful.





**[Face Cartography](http://www.aec.at/radicalatoms/en/face-cartography/)** by Daniel Boschung - a robot moves a camera around to 600 different vantage points of a subject's face. The photos are stitched together into a tremendously high resolution photo. The shoot takes 20 minutes to produce one portrait - is this a snapshot?

**[BitterCoin](http://www.ufg.ac.at/Bitter-Coin.12968.0.html)** by Martin Nadal and Cesar Escudero Andaluz - an incredibly slow but deeply charming bitcoin miner made from an old calculator.





**[Loopers](http://www.aec.at/radicalatoms/en/artist-lab-yasuaki-kakehi/)** by Yasuaki Kakehi and Michinari Kono - 12 magnetic worms crawl back and forth to create rhythmic clicks.
