Over the weekend, my wife's mom, Emily, set aside [this awesome article from the New York Review of Books](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2010/sep/30/save-warburg-library/). Go Emily!

Written by Anthony Grafton and Jeffrey Hamburger, it is titled "Save the Warburg Library!".  In it, they explain the crisis the Warburg is in financially (hence the title).  But more importantly, they describe what makes this Art History library so unique -- the cataloging scheme.  The stacks are open, and the juxtaposition of books _"will bring the reader not only to the books he or she is looking for, but also to their unexpected 'good neighbours'."_

From the Warburg Institute Library's [web site](http://warburg.sas.ac.uk/mnemosyne/entrance.htm):


<blockquote>The                  350,000 or so volumes are classified in four sections: social                  and political history (fourth floor); religion, history of science                  and philosophy (third and fourth floors); literature, books, libraries                  and education (second floor and basement); history of art (first                  floor, with classical art and archaeology in the basement). There                  are c. 2,500 runs of periodicals, about half of them current (mobile                  stacks in the basement). Readers have free access to the Library                  Holdings.</blockquote>


Needless to say, this is very different from how the Library of Congress organizes things.  But who's to say that the LC system is better?  Different researchers have different needs, so this begs the question: _Can we make Harvard's collection "look" like the Warburg's? _

I've been looking into visualizations book collections, so what if we rendered a shelf of virtual books based on the Warburg logic?  Or Princeton Univerity's Richardson system which groups all the books by each author together?

What are the benefits to our library singing Karaoke?
