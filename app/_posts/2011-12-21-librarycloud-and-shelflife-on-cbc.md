The CBC show Spark a couple of days ago ran an [8 minute piece](http://www.cbc.ca/books/2011/12/david-weinberger.html) about the two biggest projects coming out of the Harvard Library Innovation Lab, ShelfLife and LibraryCloud. It does a great job cutting together an interview of me with an illuminating narrative from Nora Young.

Spark also has posted the [full, uncut interview](http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2011/12/full-interview-david-weinberger-on-librarycloud-and-shelflife/) and a good [blog post](http://www.cbc.ca/books/2011/12/david-weinberger.html) about it.
