A couple months back on the airplane, I made a version of this list.  Some loose observations/questions about the Lab, what we've been focusing on, what we could be looking at...

1. **Measuring success** - What constitutes a successful project?  What is our (LIL) metric?

2. **Off-line innovation** -We're focusing on software & data, how can we expand our scope offline?

3. **Voyeurism sells** - Our most successful endeavors (as measured by eliciting a response [IMO]) have pulled back the curtain, allowing people to "see in" the library. People are curious, how can we leverage this voyeurism to make great projects?

4. **See our assets with fresh eyes** - Libraries have several amazing assets to leverage for innovation (that start-ups could only dream of):



	
  1. _central location_ - public libraries, private ones, academic - libraries are always sited at the heart of everything

	
  2. _librarians_ - an interested community, a live and in-person customer support staff

	
  3. _strong user base_ -- a community of patrons

	
  4. _transaction data_ - we can still identify trends, learn about the community while respecting privacy

	
  5. _trust_ - people trust libraries and librarians as purveyors

	
  6. _inventory_ - stuff (books, dvds, mags, kindles?) people want, for "free trial"


5. **The Library experience **- Libraries, in general, have looked the same for quite a while.  The experience visiting a library, the services provided, the look hasn't changed too much.  What would the most far-out, radical library be?

6. **Future** - The future of the library is not the future of the book.  But how is it not?

7. **A culture of innovation** - How can we, as a Lab, both advance large projects, while also pursuing smaller ideas and experiments?
