Soo Young Rieh is an associate professor at the University of Michigan School of Information. She recently finished a study (funded in part by MacArthur) on how people assess the credibility of sources when they are just searching for information and when they are actually posting information. Her study didn't focus on a particular age or gender, and found [SPOILER] that we don't take extra steps to assess the credibility of information when we are publishing it.
