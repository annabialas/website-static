Paul, David, and I spent part of last week in San Francisco at [DPLA West.](http://dp.la/get-involved/events/dplawest/)

We were at DPLA West to chat about the DPLA, our work on the [Platform](http://dp.la/dev/wiki/), and the recent [DPLA Hackfest](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dplaalpha/2012/04/06/dpla-hackathon-gives-developers-first-look-at-dpla-platform/).

The event was held at the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/) and at the [San Francisco Public Library](http://sfpl.org/). Wonderful venues.

One of the highlights of the event was a tour the Internet Archive's physical archive.

Thanks to DPLA, SFPL, and the Internet Archive for making us feel welcome on the West Coast.
