I've posted a [podcast interview with Dan Cohen](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/dev/david/podcasts/DanCohenFCC.mp3), the executive director of the [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la) about [their proposal to the FCC](http://dp.la/info/2013/09/26/dpla-fcc-erate-upgrade/). 



The FCC is looking for ways to modernize the [E-Rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Rate) program that has brought the Internet to libraries and schools. The DPLA is proposing _DPLA Local_, which will enable libraries to create online digital collections using the DPLA's platform.



I'm excited about this for two reasons beyond the service it would provide. 



First, it could be a first step toward providing cloud-based library services, instead of the  proprietary, closed, expensive systems libraries typically use to manage their data. ([Evergreen](evergreen-ils.org/), I'm not talking about you, you open source scamp!) 



Second, as libraries build their collections using DPLA Local, their metadata is likely to assume normalized forms, which means that we should get cross-collection discovery and semantic riches.



Here's the [proposal itself](http://dp.la/info/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/E-rate_Comment_DPLA.pdf). And here's where [you can comment to the FCC](http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/) about it.
