people want to talk on their cell phones when theyâ€™re working in the library. letâ€™s accommodate these desires by providing secure and private talking spaces

[![reading-room](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/a31bf2be-eebb-4860-b28d-cee1f084072b.jpg)](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/a31bf2be-eebb-4860-b28d-cee1f084072b.jpg)

what is the shape of a private talking space in a library? we donâ€™t know, but weâ€™re thinking hard and talking to a lot of different folks that know how libraries are used

maybe the space ends up being a phone booth from the recent past, or maybe itâ€™s a hood that lowers over a carrell, or maybe itâ€™s an interstitial passageway with a sound deadening ceiling, or maybe itâ€™s simply a heavy curtain that you can pull around you, or maybe itâ€™s something else

weâ€™re collaborating with WorkShop to understand how people want to talk on their phones in libraries. once we gain some understanding, weâ€™ll fabricate a solution for the Harvard Law School Library (and beyond!)

we kicked this effort off a few days ago with a charrette and a tour of the HLSL physical space, Langdell hall

please toss an email our way if you know of other folks that have thought about private talking spaces. weâ€™ll keep you in the loop as we think, design, and build ðŸ’š
