I received an overdue notice a little while back.  I've received them many times.  But I looked at it and I realized it was pretty complicated.

  * Did I really need to know the Barcode number?

	
  * The date and time I originally took it out.

	
  * Why was the title so buried?

	
  * etc...


So here's just an idea, implementing such a thing into our ILS would be difficult and demand sign-off all the way up the food chain.



But what if it could be simple HTML?

Maybe we could add a 1-click renew button.  Or, maybe a courtesy auto-renew.  Perhaps in the future we could add opt-in events listings or book recommendations, etc.

Overdue notices are the primary correspondence between the library and its community.  We should give them their due attention.
